# Algorithms
HW from the NNU Algorithms class. Each Solution will be described in more details below. 


## 0 -1 Knapsack Dynamic Programming: README
This program will complete the 0-1 Knapsack problem
using Dynamic Programming to solve for:
Optimal Solution: {values}
Optimal Solution's Weight: {value}
Optimal Solution's Value: {value}
Number of Table References: {value}
Dynamic Programming Table:  {values}

For this project there are a few things to note.
In order to run the program correctly, there are a few
command line parameters that must be passed in.
There are 4 arguments. The arguments follow this layout:
numberOfItemsInFiles=5, maximumWeightOfKnapsack=5, weightsFile=weights1.txt, valuesFile=values1.txt
EXAMPLE OF WHAT WOULD BE PASSED IN:
"5" "5" ".../weights.txt" ".../values.txt"

Example solution: 
Arguments passed in: "5" "5" ".../weights.txt" ".../values.txt"
   SOLUTIONS  | ANS
------------- | -------------
The optimal Solution is:  | I3 I4
Optimal Solution's Weight:  | 5
Optimal Solution's Value:   | 14
Number of Table References:  | 80


## 0 -1 Knapsack Recursive Solution: README
This program will complete the 0-1 Knapsack problem
using recursion to solve for:
Optimal Solution: {values}
Optimal Solution's Weight: {value}
Optimal Solution's Value: {value}
Number of Recursive Calls: {value}

As seen before, there are a few things to note
about this project. The command lines follow those seen above.
The arguments follow this layout:
numberOfItemsInFiles=5, maximumWeightOfKnapsack=5, weightsFile=weights1.txt, valuesFile=values1.txt
EXAMPLE OF WHAT WOULD BE PASSED IN:
"5" "5" ".../weights.txt" ".../values.txt"
